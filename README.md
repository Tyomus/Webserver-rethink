# Webserver-rethink

## Introduction ##
Since every one of us has at least one or two unused "old" smartphone laying around at home, it gave me the idea to repurpose them for future plans. Since they are no less than a small computer, with some modifiction they can be among other things e.g. web servers for smaller projects, or even as a network attached storage (NAS).
